 * Attribution types shared across networks.
 *
 * Current network: Apple Search Ads (via AdServices framework tokens).
 * Future networks (Meta, Google Ads, TikTok) slot in here by adding to
 * `ATTRIBUTION_NETWORKS` and contributing their own property prefix.
 *
 * Property model:
 *   - `attribution_source` is a single cross-network property whose value
 *     identifies the winning network (e.g. "apple_search_ads", "meta"),
 *     "none" when capture happened but the network didn't attribute, or
 *     "apple_test_install" for Apple's deliberate non-production fixture
 *     (TestFlight / Xcode dev build / simulator) — see `appleTestInstall`
 *     below.
 *   - Network-specific fields are namespaced by prefix (`asa_*`, `meta_*`, …).

//      and off incoming webhooks. Webhook *delivery* is subscription-gated by
//      RC, so free users only receive enrichment via bulk sync.
