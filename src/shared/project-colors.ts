// Canonical palette used by the server to auto-assign a color when a project
// is created, and by the web dashboard to offer swatch presets in the color
// picker. Stored as `#RRGGBB` hex strings.
//
// NOTE: the initial backfill migration (see packages/db/drizzle) embeds a
// snapshot of this list. That is a deliberate one-time duplication — the
// migration represents a point in time and should not change if this palette
// is later edited.
